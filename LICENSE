I'm not wasting my time on legal jargon, use this if you want, steal it if you want, but don't blame me if it doesn't do what you expect. I'm writing and maintaining this for me (Matt Gilmore) so don't be surprised when it doesn't work for you (not Matt Gilmore). I'm reserving the right to change this agreement at any time, for any reason, and to do whatever I want to do with my code commercially.
